# HYPOTHESIS-TESTING


DEFINING THE QUESTION 

a)Problem statement 

Investigating a claim about the blue cars from the autilob dataset.  

Ho :Average of blue cars taken = Average of blue car returned 
H1 : Average of blue cars taken is not equal to the Average of blue car returned 
     Therefore  
       Ho:U ;taken =returned  
       H1:U ; taken &lt;/> returned.

b) Metric for Success 

The objectives for this data includes investigating the claim listed above and knowing whether or not the the average number of blue cars taken is different that of the blue cars returned 

c) Understanding context 

we have been tasked to understand electric car usage by solving for another research question.Working as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset. In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made. 


d) Recording the Experimental Design 

1)Defining the research question 

2)Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset. 

3)Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.  

4)Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing. 

5)Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements. Defining the research question  e) 



Relevance of the data 

Data used for survey was obtained from an open datasource. The provided dataset is a daily aggregation, by date and postal code, of the number of events on the Autolib network (car-sharing and recharging).Dataset used ranges from january to july of 2018 and is relevant for this analysis
